# My Smart Home Automation System

Welcome to my Smart Home Automation System, a personalized IoT solution for my home! Built with an ESP8266 microcontroller, this project is all about automating home appliances and enhancing the living experience. Feel free to explore this repository for inspiration and ideas for your projects.

## 🌟 Features
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Connects the ESP8266 to my home Wi-Fi network.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Controls various home appliances using servo motors.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes HTTP & HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- **Basic Authentication**: Protects device controls via basic HTTP authentication.
- **Web Interface**: A simple web interface for controlling home appliances.
- **API Integration**: Reports device states to a remote API for better tracking.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Setup**: Clone this repository and set up your ESP8266 module.
2. **Wi-Fi Configuration**: Update the `Credentials.h` with your Wi-Fi details.
3. **Wiring**: Check the below image for the wiring layout of one servo motor(others follow the same logic). ![Wiring Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/QvD0WnW/wiring.png)
